# Journal-Tracker

Fork from version 7 of yekenuk/Weight-Loss-Tracker,  changing focus to be "Activity" tracking while retaining
the original core "Weight Loss" component.   Because we are not removing the original functionallity, these two
projects CANNOT co-exist on a single wordpress installation.
